# Market Risk Modeling and Validation: A Quantitative Approach to VaR

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive, model risk-aware framework for estimating and validating Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) using multiple quantitative techniques. It is designed to simulate real-world model validation workflows as expected in Model Risk Governance teams at leading financial institutions.

The goal is not just to estimate VaR, but to **stress-test, compare, and validate** different approaches for robustness, transparency, and risk sensitivity — reflecting the principles of **Basel/ FRTB-aligned model governance**.

| Technique                         | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Historical Simulation**        | Non-parametric VaR using historical portfolio returns.                      |
| **Monte Carlo Simulation**       | Parametric VaR using normal distribution of returns.                        |
| **Student-t Monte Carlo**        | Captures fat tails with Student-t distribution.                             |
| **GARCH(1,1) Forecasting**       | Volatility clustering via ARCH models, forecasting risk.                   |
| **Put Option Hedging**           | VaR impact with a basic derivatives hedging strategy.                       |
| **Copula-Based Simulation**      | Dependency modeling between asset returns using Gaussian copula.            |
| **Extreme Value Theory (EVT)**   | Tail-focused risk modeling with Peaks-Over-Threshold method.               |
| **VaR Comparison Table**         | Consolidated side-by-side VaR/ES estimates across models.                  |
| **Visual Analysis**              | Histograms, KDE plots, VaR/ES lines, and violation shading.                |
